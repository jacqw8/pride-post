# pride-post

A web application made with Python and Flask that allows users to post messages either anonymously or as themselves to the community board to support anyone who reads it, namely the LGBTQA+ audience. However, our machine learning model embedded in the website utilizes sentiment analysis to ensure that every post is positive and uplifting. For example, if a meanspirited user decides to upload a negative, especially homophobic, message, their post will be caught by our model and deleted before it is even uploaded.
